Recycon: A Sustainable Marketplace for Recycling Content

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Recycon, an innovative website project developed as part of a web programming course in semester 5. Recycon is a platform that aims to raise awareness about environmental sustainability and combat global warming by providing a marketplace for customers to buy and sell recycled or second-hand products.

The primary technologies utilized in Recycon's development are PHP and Laravel, which enable the creation of a robust and dynamic web application. Leveraging the power and flexibility of these technologies, Recycon offers a user-friendly interface and a seamless browsing experience for customers.

## Key Features:

### Product Listings 
Recycon allows users to browse through a wide range of recycled and second-hand products. Each product listing provides detailed information, including product images, descriptions, pricing, and seller details.

### User Accounts 
To enhance the user experience, Recycon incorporates user account functionality. Customers can create personalized accounts and manage their profile information

### Search and Filtering 
With a vast array of products available, Recycon incorporates powerful search and filtering options. Customers can quickly find specific items based on categories, product name, and other relevant attributes.

### Admin Dashboard 
Recycon empowers sellers by providing them with a dedicated dashboard. Admin can manage their product listings and track product sales.

### Environmental Impact Tracker 
Recycon goes beyond being just a marketplace by incorporating an environmental impact tracker. This feature quantifies the positive impact made by customers through their purchases, such as reducing carbon emissions, waste, and overall resource consumption.

## 

We believe that Recycon has the potential to contribute significantly to the global effort towards sustainability and environmental preservation.
